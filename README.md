# Description
This program was made as a training.

## Technical task
Write a Java console app that would filter the stream of text information fed to the input and show only those lines that contain the word passed to the program as an argument.

**Variants of complication:**
1. The program should not be case-sensitive.
2. As an argument, you can specify not a specific word, but a regular expression.
